      "1": {
        "title": "1. Vision and inspiration",
        "description": "Tell us what kind of website you want. Share your preferred style, colors, features, and structure (single-page or multi-page, contact forms, booking, newsletter, etc.). If you have examples you like, send them — or browse our inspiration gallery. Let us know your desired domain, and we’ll check its availability. If it’s taken, we’ll suggest alternatives."
      },
      "2": {
        "title": "2. Draft and offer",
        "description": "Based on your ideas, we create a visual sketch showing the site’s overall structure. You’ll receive a transparent quote and timeline. Note: delivery time may vary depending on later changes."
      },
      "3": {
        "title": "3. Agreement and Content",
        "description": "Once everything is aligned, we’ll send over the agreement. Work begins once the signed document and all required content (texts, images, functions, preferences) have been received. This isn’t just a technical prerequisite — it’s the foundation of a smooth and inspired collaboration. The more complete the start, the faster and more enjoyable the process."
      },
      "4": {
        "title": "4. Development and feedback",
        "description": "We build the site step by step. You’ll receive regular visual updates to track progress and ensure alignment. Based on your feedback, we refine and adjust."
      },
      "5": {
        "title": "5. Testing and handover prep",
        "description": "Once ready, we begin a one-week testing phase. The domain goes live, Google Analytics is set up, security features are activated, and technical details are fine-tuned."
      },
      "6": {
        "title": "6. Payment and final delivery",
        "description": "At the end of the project, once everything is in place, payment is due. After that, we’ll deliver the full website and, if requested, continue with maintenance. Access to the site is granted once the final payment has been received — ensuring every detail is in place and the project is truly complete."
